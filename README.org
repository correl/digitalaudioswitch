** Deploying
Connect the ESP32 to your computer. If you haven't already, [[https://micropython.org/download/esp32/][flash it with the
latest version of MicroPython]], and ensure you have [[https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html][mpremote installed]].

Running =make= will install dependencies and copy the code and configuration to
the ESP32, resetting it when done.
